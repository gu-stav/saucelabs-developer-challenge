# Saucelabs developer challenge

## Setup

`npm install`


## Development

`npm run watch` will run the application on http://localhost:3000/ and automatically reload after you made changes.


### Code standards

`npm run lint` will lint the code. Prettier is already included, therefore running `npm run lint -- --fix` will fix all possible occurences, according to `.eslintrc`.


## Run

`npm run serve` will run the application on http://localhost:3000/.
